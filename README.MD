# About
This is a project for Carleton University Comp 4601 class
Our project is a prototype for a system that recommends friends for you to delete from your social media friends lists. In order to do this we use a combination of ranking, clustering and raw heuristics analysis to implement a recommender system that determines which of a users friends they might want to remove.

# To Use

+ Node.js https://nodejs.org/en/

## Setup
+ Download the code
+ Navigate to the download directory in your terminal
+ Enter the following commands:

  + ``npm install``

## Run

You will know that the web service is running when the terminal spits out the message:  ``Web Service listening on port 3000!``
